# Story Idea Generator

## This is the first version of the Story Idea Generator App that I created.

I created this app as a way to fight writer's block, and figured it would be a fun way for writers to get a basic plot from which to work. The app contains three lists: one containing a collection of basic protagonists, a collection of actions, and a collection of random words to complete the sentence. On button click, the user is given a very basic plot that is open to interpretation. I also used this project to learn Gatsby.

The newer version of this app can be found [here](https://github.com/Holgermueller/SIGMK2).
